                I have been working had to reach the position I am in.
                The code that I write is extremely sufficient and optimal.
                Not only that though, it also improves readability for co-workers
                which means that we can excel in everything that we program... Together.

                I am a hard worker. I do nothing more than work.
                Work, work, work. I know nothing else. I don't make excuses,
                for I am not weak. I know that if I want an easy life later on,
                then I must work hard now.

            <h2>Plans for future</h2>
            <p>
                As of right now, I practice my craft. But for the future,
                my decision and my path has been laid, i just hope i keep on, on a clear path. I have had thoughts of
                working within the Cyber Security field, though that
                thought is final and where am working too.
